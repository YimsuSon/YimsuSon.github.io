### 5.Data Preprocessing

- 5.1 Aggregation
- Combining two or more attributes (or objects) into a single attribute (or object)
- Purpose
    - Data reduction
        - Reduce the number of attributes or objects
    - Change of scale
        - Cities aggregated into regions, states, countries, etc.
        - Days aggregated into weeks, months, or years
    - More “stable” data
         - Aggregated data tends to have less variability 

- Example: Precipitation in Australia


- 5.2 Sampling


- 5.3 Dimensionality Reduction


- 5.4 Feature subset selection


- 5.6 Feature creation


- 5.7 Discretization and Binarization


- 5.8 Attribute Transformation
