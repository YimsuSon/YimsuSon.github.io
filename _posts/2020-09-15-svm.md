### SVM algorithm

<br/>
<br/>

### 1. SVM algorithm
<br/>

- What is support vector machine algorithm?
    - The method that divide into data and furthest hyper plane, and then make tow group.

<br/>

- Max margine hyper plane
    - hyper plane : w * x + b = 0
    - To seek w which make max margin ( ![image](/assets/images/computervision/20200915_2.png) )

<br/>

- How to solve?
    -> define Constrainsts, Lagrange multiplier, KTT condition, etc

- The solution
    -> The optimal solution for seperating the given data.

- Allow misclassification
    - If the given sample is couldn't divided perfectly two group, Misclassification is allowed.

<br/>

- C value is parameter set by user
- If C value is high, misclassification error will be low but margin is also to be low
